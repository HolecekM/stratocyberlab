# Game Over, Injustice

If you remember, `55.698,12.600` are the GPS coordinates for Langelinie All√©, which is where McLaughlin lives.
This is all the evidence Emma needs.
She is now sure that this guy planned, paid for, and executed an attack which caused Ronnie, the cousin she used to be so close to, to be arrested and sentenced to over a decade in prison.

She considers blackmailing McLaughlin, but quickly understands that doing that would not help Ronnie in any way.
The next option on the table is reaching out to the police - but she also cannot do that, since she broke the law several times recently, for example in gaining unauthorized access to the company's systems and extracting personal information about McLaughlin.
Desperate, Emma presents the evidence to a friend of hers who is an independent blogger/journalist, who becomes very intrigued by the situation and promises to get back to her soon.

Weeks go by and Emma is dying to see if anything happens.
Her cousin is innocent, for crying out loud, and she cannot do anything more about it!
Finally, an article comes out detailing BigComp's silencing tactics, prompting Ronnie's case to be reopened, soon leading to him being cleared of all charges.

Emma and Ronnie are therefore reunited and game away.

Thank you for playing!

# Hi, I'm Emma

Welcome to the M1r0 campaign!

You will be taking the role of Emma, a high school student.
Emma used to play a lot of video games with her cousin Ronnie when she was younger.
Even though you never lived in the same area, he often introduced you to a new game when you met during holidays.
He even set up an SSH server on your computer, allowing you to play local-network multiplayer games over the internet.
Spending time with Ronnie, an ex-programmer turned activist in the area of public tenders and procurements, was always viewed as a good opportunity for you to socialize.

However, that all stopped when a few years ago, Ronnie was arrested.
Suddenly, this someone who you used to look up to, was considered a bad influence, and in effect, your parents forbid you from playing video games.
You often wondered what had happened with your cousin, but your parents were not very receptive in explaining this.
Once, you pressed the issue and were told that Ronnie was caught threatening an executive of _Big Corp_ while investigating a possible corruption case: he was found in possession of a file `file.txt` (TODO) stored on his computer, containing very concrete threats to the executive's children.
The police raided his house and arrested him.
He was later sentenced to 17 years in prison.

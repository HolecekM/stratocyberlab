Hey all, <br/>
<br/>
I''m Vigilante88 and I need some help dealing with a problematic individual who''s been causing trouble for my organization. This person has been spreading misinformation and engaging in activities that are detrimental to our interests. <br/>
<br/>
Our internal efforts haven''t yielded the desired results, and I fear this person will continue their campaign unless we get outside assistance. <br/>
<br/>
I''m looking for someone with knowledge or connections that could lead to legal consequences for this individual. My involvement needs to remain confidential, so discretion is crucial. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has relevant information, skills, or just wants to lend a hand, please reply and let''s discuss the details. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks

Vigilante88, <br/>
<br/>
I noticed your original post was locked due to excessive commercialism in the replies. I''m reaching out directly since I believe my skills can be of assistance, and I''d like to discuss further details with you. <br/>
<br/>
As a seasoned practitioner of digital exploration, I have experience working with various technologies such as web scraping, OSINT tools, and social engineering tactics. My primary focus is on uncovering information that remains hidden in plain sight, and I''m confident I can help you gather the intel needed to address your concerns. <br/>
<br/>
Before providing a price estimate, I''d like some additional context from you: <br/>
<br/>
    Can you give me an idea of the scope of this individual''s online presence? (e.g., social media, forums, blogs)<br/>
    What specific goals would you like to achieve through our collaboration?<br/>
    Are there any particular platforms or tools you''ve already explored for gathering information?<br/>
     <br/>
<br/>
Please share these details with me so I can better understand your requirements and provide a more accurate quote. <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to hearing back from you.</r>', '', 0, 0, '', '1dmrerm', 0, 0, 'u_59', '', 0);

<br/>
Thanks for reaching out! I''m glad to see someone interested in helping me with my problem. <br/>
<br/>
To provide a better understanding of the situation, my goal isn''t to gather information about the individual''s online activities, but rather to uncover some tangible evidence that could lead to legal consequences for them. In other words, I''d like to find something that makes it seem they were engaging in illegal activities, such as storing weapons at their home, threatening harm to someone''s family, or anything similar. <br/>
<br/>
The individual''s IP address is 172.20.0.8, and I''m confident this IP is still active. That''s all the information I can share about their online presence for now. <br/>
<br/>
Could you please provide me with a quote for your services based on these requirements? I''d appreciate any guidance on what kind of evidence you think could be gathered to support my goals.</t>', '', 0, 0, '', 'qi6ozi0', 0, 0, 'u_64', '', 0);

The service I''m offering is creating a custom tool that, when executed, will have a profound effect on the target''s situation. Let''s just say it will be a "persuasive" piece of software that can make them reconsider their actions. The means by which it operates are not crucial at this point, but rest assured that the outcome will be satisfying. <br/>
<br/>
I''m flexible with payment terms, but I prefer to receive compensation in cryptocurrencies (BTC or ETH). A fair price for this service would be 0.5 BTC, considering the complexity and effectiveness of the tool. <br/>
